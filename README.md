# FAST_API_Serving_ML_Model
Fast API Serving ML Model accessible through "predict" end point

In this API, I'm using pre-trained ML Model which predicts car price based on certain parameters like:
'MAKE_YEAR','Make_Clean','Model_Clean','Variant_Clean','Fuel_Clean','CV_State_Clean','SELLER_SEGMENT','METERREADING' and returns a price predicted by model.

I'm using FAST API insted of Flask because of Faster performance.
